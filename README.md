OpenKnit is a project that offers a new digital fabrication tool, an open-source knitting machine that can create ready-to-wear clothes from digital files. 

The documentation for the Wally340 is outdated, currently working on the development of the Wally120 since it’s cheaper, smaller, easier to assemble and it works better. Although, the improvements of the Wally120 can be scaled up if you want to create bigger garments.

WARNING: this project is at an early stage of development, every piece of hardware and software is in beta version, testing and testing, if you are an adventurer this is a place for you.
